CodingSpectator
===============

CodingSpectator is an Eclipse plug-in developed at the University of Illinois.  This plug-in listens for various actions that the user performs while working with Eclipse. CodingSpectator gathers a rich set of data about the usage of Eclipse that could reveal many interesting patterns in the usage of this IDE.

CodingSpectator saves the captured events locally and uploads them to a designated server periodically. It also categorizes the data based on the user id and Eclipse workspace id.
