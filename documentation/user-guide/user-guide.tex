\section{Prerequisites}
%
You should be using Eclipse 3.6 Helios. You may check which version you have
installed by looking at the logo that appears during startup; it should say
Eclipse Helios.

\warnnote{Please note that the plug-in cannot be installed on an older version
of Eclipse e.g. Eclipse 3.5 Ganymede. It only works with Eclipse 3.6 Helios. If
you are using Helios or newer versions of Eclipse and are having problems please
contact us.}
%
\section{Installing \codspec}

After installing Eclipse, you need to install our plug-in by following the steps
below:

\begin{enumerate}
%
\item In Eclipse, go to \uiref{Help > Install New Software...}.
%
\item Click the \uiref{Add} button on the top right corner of the dialog.
%
\item Add a new update site. Set the \uiref{Name} to \codspec\ and the
\uiref{Location} to \url{http://codingspectator.cs.illinois.edu/updates} as
shown in Figure~\ref{FigAddSite}. Then, click \uiref{OK}.

\begin{figure}[h]
%
\centering
%
{\fig{figs/add_site}}
%
\caption{\label{FigAddSite}Add the update site of \codspec.}
%
\end{figure}

\item After adding the update site of \codspec, select the \codspec\ features as
shown in Figure~\ref{FigSelectFeatures}.

\begin{figure}[h]
%
\centering
%
\fig{figs/select_features}
%
\caption{\label{FigSelectFeatures}Select all the features of \codspec\ to
install}
%
\end{figure}

\item Click \uiref{Next} to proceed.

\item You will now be presented with the \uiref{Install Details} dialog window
listing the items that will be installed. Ensure that the \codspec\ plug-in and
all its components are selected. Click \uiref{Next}.

\item You will now be presented with the \uiref{Review Licenses} dialog window
detailing the licenses of the plug-ins that will be installed. Take a moment to
review them, and if you agree, proceed by clicking \uiref{Finish}.

\item Eclipse should open the dialog in Figure~\ref{FigCertificate} asking you
to confirm that you accept our certificate. Please accept our certificate to
install \codspec.

\begin{figure}[h]
%
\centering
%
\fig{figs/certificate}
%
\caption{\label{FigCertificate}The dialog that asks if you trust the certificate
of \codspec.}
%
\end{figure}

\item If Eclipse cannot retrieve the installation files of \codspec, it will
open a dialog such as the one shown in Figure~\ref{FigUnsignedWarning} warning
you that you are installing unsigned content. If you see this dialog, it means
that Eclipse has failed to install \codspec\ correctly. Click \uiref{OK} to
dismiss the dialog. Then, uninstall \codspec\ (See
Section~\ref{SecUninstallation}), and try to install it again. If the problem
persists, please contact us.

\centering
%
\fig{figs/warning}
%
\caption{\label{FigUnsignedWarning}The dialog that warns about unsigned content
implies that Eclipse has failed to install \codspec.}
%
\end{figure}

\item A dialog will pop-up asking you to restart Eclipse after the software
updates. Click \uiref{Restart Now}. Please do \textbf{not} use the other options
on that dialog.

\item You have successfully installed our plug-in.
%
\end{enumerate}
%
\section{Using \codspec}
%
\codspec is a non-intrusive extension that monitors your coding activities
inside Eclipse. Specifically, it collects data about your use of the Java
development tools in Eclipse. \codspec will run in the background and will not
interfere with your coding routines except for the occasional dialog asking you
to upload your data. Your data will be uploaded to a secure server at the
University of Illinois that only the researchers have access to.

\infonote{Our plug-in will monitor for programming behavior in \textbf{all}
workspaces that you create using that particular Eclipse instance. As detailed
on the consent form, the plug-in will record certain code development activities
that are performed in the workspace and store that information. In addition, the
plug-in might collect some code snippets to provide more context to the
activities that are being performed.

If you have sensitive data that you do not wish the plug-in to collect, you
would need to install two instances of Eclipse: one with our plug-in and one
\textbf{without} our plug-in.

Please feel free to talk to us if you have any questions and concerns about your
privacy. We can work our a suitable compromise.}
%
\section{Automatic upload of data}

\textbf{Once a day (at most)}, during the initial startup of Eclipse, you might
be presented with the dialog box shown in Figure~\ref{FigLogin} asking you to
upload your data. Please provide your \codspec\ user name and password when
prompted.

\begin{figure}[h]
%
\centering
%
\fig{figs/login}
%
\caption{\label{FigLogin}The dialog that asks your \codspec\ account information
in order to upload your data to \codspec\ servers.}
%
\end{figure}

If you provide the wrong user name/password, our plug-in will prompt you again
with the dialog in Figure~\ref{FigPrompt}:

\begin{figure}[h]
%
\centering
%
\fig{figs/prompt}
%
\caption{\label{FigPrompt}This dialog shows up when the user name and password
that you have entered are wrong.}
%
\end{figure}

If you forget your user name or password, please contact us to send them to you.
Also, you can change your password by visiting
\url{http://codingspectator.cs.illinois.edu/Accounts/}.

If you wish, you may also click on the \uiref{Save password (could trigger
secure storage)} check box. This will ask Eclipse to store your username and
password using its underlying
\href{http://help.eclipse.org/helios/index.jsp?topic=/org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/guide/secure_storage_dev.htm}{Secure
Storage mechanism}. If you decide to save your password, it will proceed to ask
you to create a master password. Please follow the instructions on screen as
they depend on the operating system.

Additionally, if you decide to save your password, on subsequent uploads of
\codspec, you will no longer see the dialog above but one of the dialogs in
Figure~\ref{FigSecureStoragePrompt} depending on your operating system.

\begin{figure}[h]

%
\fig{figs/LinuxMasterPasswordDialog}
%
\caption{\label{FigSecureStoragePrompt}If you save your \codspec\ account
information in Eclipse, you will see one of these dialogs at your future
attempts to log into \codspec.}
%
\end{figure}

Please enter the \textbf{master password} that you have created (\textbf{not}
your \codspec\ password) when prompted by the Secure Storage dialog box.

\section{Manual upload of data}

You may also trigger the data upload manually. We provide this facility because,
occasionally, it might not be convenient to upload the data during the startup
of Eclipse.

To invoke the manual uploading of your data, you can go to \uiref{Window >
Preferences} (on Linux and Windows) or \uiref{Eclipse > Preferences...} (on Mac
OS X). Click on the \uiref{\codspec} section shown in
Figure~\ref{FigPreferences}.

\begin{figure}[h]
%
\centering
%
\fig{figs/preferences}
%
\caption{\label{FigPreferences}\codspec\ adds an item to the preferences page of
Eclipse.}
%
\end{figure}

In that preference pane, you will see:

\begin{enumerate}
%
\item a special ID that we use to identify the workspace that you are working
on,
%
\item the date and time of your last upload and
%
\item an \uiref{Upload Now} button that you can invoke to upload your data.
%
\end{enumerate}

\section{Eclipse plug-in development}

If you develop Eclipse plug-ins and test your plug-ins by running new instances
of Eclipse, there is an additional step that you need to perform before
\textbf{running/debugging/testing} your plug-in: you need to modify your launch
configuration so that it does \textbf{not} launch our \codspec\ plug-in. This
prevents it from popping-up the dialog window each time you run/debug/test your
plug-in and prevents it from spuriously logging your data.

\begin{enumerate}
%
\item Create a new \uiref{Target Platform} configuration. Go to \uiref{Window >
Preference} (on Linux and Windows) or \uiref{Eclipse > Preferecences...} (on Mac
OS X). Type in \uiref{target} in the search dialog to shorten the list to bring
up the \uiref{Target Platform} preferences.
%
\item Click on \uiref{Target Platform} on the list on the left to go to the
target platform page shown in Figure~\ref{FigTargetPlatformStep1}.

\begin{figure}[h]
%
\centering
%
\fig{figs/target_step1}
%
\caption{\label{FigTargetPlatformStep1}The target platform page is on the
Eclipse preferences page.}
%
\end{figure}
%
\item Click \uiref{Add} on the right hand side of the window.
%
\item In the dialog that appears, select the second option \uiref{Default:
Default target for running platform} shown in
Figure~\ref{FigTargetPlatformStep2}.

\begin{figure}[h]
%
\centering
%
\fig{figs/target_step2}
%
\caption{\label{FigTargetPlatformStep2}Select the second option to create a new
target definition.}
%
\end{figure}

\item Click \uiref{Next}.
%
\item The dialog in Figure~\ref{FigTargetPlatformStep3} should appear. Put
\uiref{\codspec} for the new name in text field at the top of the dialog.
%
\item Click on the \uiref{Content} tab. Type in \uiref{edu.illinois} to narrow
down the list of plug-ins. Then, \textbf{Deselect} the following (and only the
following): 

edu.illinois.codingspectator.monitor.ui

\begin{figure}[h]

%
\caption{\label{FigTargetPlatformStep3}Edit the target definition by deselecting
the plug-in edu.illinois.codingspectator.monitor.ui.}
%
\end{figure}
%
\item Click \uiref{Finish}.
%
\item As shown in Figure~\ref{FigTargetPlatformStep4}, your new target
definition appears on the preferences page. \textbf{Check} the \uiref{\codspec\
Target Platform} that you have just created.

\begin{figure}[h]

created for \codspec.}
%
\end{figure}
%
\item Click \uiref{OK}.
%
\end{enumerate}
%
\section{Updating \codspec}

During this research study, we might require you to update \codspec. Should this
become necessary, we will contact you via e-mail to upgrade the plug-in. This is
a simple process that you can perform by going to \uiref{Help > Check for
Updates} (See Figure~\ref{FigUpdate}) in the Eclipse application.

\begin{figure}[h]

%
\section{\label{SecUninstallation}Uninstalling \codspec}

\begin{enumerate}
%
\item You can uninstall our plug-in through the \uiref{About Eclipse...} dialog.
You can invoke the dialog shown in Figure~\ref{FigUninstallStep1} by going to
\uiref{Eclipse > About Eclipse...} on OS X or through \uiref{Help > About
Eclipse...} on Linux and Windows.
